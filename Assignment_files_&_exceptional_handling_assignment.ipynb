        "\n",
        "Ans..When Multithreading is Better: I/O-Bound Tasks: Tasks like reading/writing to files, database operations, or web scraping, where threads can wait while the CPU does other things. Lightweight Parallelism: When tasks share memory and need to communicate often, multithreading avoids the overhead of creating multiple processes. Limited Resources: When you can’t afford to create multiple processes due to memory constraints.\n",
        "When Multiprocessing is Better: CPU-Bound Tasks: Tasks like numerical computations or data processing that require heavy CPU usage. Each process gets its own CPU core, avoiding Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). Fault Isolation: If you need better isolation (e.g., one task crashing shouldn’t affect others), multiprocessing is safer. Scalability: When working on tasks that benefit from distributed systems or multi-core architectures."

        "\n",
        "Ans..A process pool is a collection of pre-initialized worker processes used to manage and execute tasks in parallel. Instead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly, the pool reuses processes, reducing overhead. It also helps distribute tasks efficiently among available workers, balancing the load and simplifying parallel execution. This is especially useful for handling a large number of tasks with limited system resources."

        "Ans..Multiprocessing in Python is the ability to run multiple processes simultaneously, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores. It is used to overcome the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents true parallelism in multithreaded Python programs. By using separate processes, each with its own memory space, multiprocessing allows Python programs to handle CPU-intensive tasks efficiently and improve performance on multi-core systems."

Resource Management: Proper handling ensures resources like locks, files, or memory are released safely. Debugging: Exceptions give insights into issues, aiding in debugging. Continuation: Allows the program to continue running even if one task fails. Techniques for Handling Exceptions: Try-Except Blocks: Wrap concurrent task logic in try-except to catch errors. Thread/Process Monitoring: Use Thread.is_alive() or Process.exitcode to detect failures. Error Logging: Log exceptions using libraries like logging for post-analysis. Return/Error Flags: Return status or error messages from threads/processes. Higher-Level Libraries: Use tools like concurrent.futures for built-in exception handling in pools."
